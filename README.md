The Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) framework was kickstarted and developed as part of a collaboration between Intel and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and describes  Intel’s commitment to the grant from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded to the UPenn for the development of the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS, https://www.fets.ai/) platform (grant award number: U01-CA242871). FeTS is an exciting, real-world medical FL platform, and we are honored to be collaborating with UPenn in leading a federation of international collaborators. Although OpenFL was designed to serve as the backend for the FeTS platform, and OpenFL developers and researchers continue to work very closely with UPenn on the FeTS project, OpenFL was built to be agnostic to the use-case and the machine learning framework, and we welcome input from domains outside medicine and imaging. 

We’ve included the FeTS-AI/Algorithms (https://github.com/FETS-AI/Algorithms) repository as a submodule of OpenFL to highlight how OpenFL serves as the FeTS backend. While not necessary to run OpenFL, the FeTS algorithms show real-world FL models and use cases. Additionally, the FeTS-AI/Front-End (https://github.com/FETS-AI/Front-End) shows how UPenn and Intel have integrated UPenn’s medical AI expertise with Intel’s OpenFL to create a federated learning solution for medical imaging.
